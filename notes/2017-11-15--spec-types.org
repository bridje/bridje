* Spec types?
ok, so we have a concept of attributes, and a concept of datatypes (maybe?)
tbh, the name of the type shouldn't really depend on where it's defined - we'd like to move definitions without changing the data

mutually recursive types?
parameterised types?

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (defdata
    #:user{:id UUID
           :username String}

    #:store{:id UUID
            :key {:req [:user.id :store.id]}})

  (deftype User (User {:req [:user.id :user.username]}))
#+END_SRC
