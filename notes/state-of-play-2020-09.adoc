= State of Play 2020-09

Getting back into Bridje after a while away, where're we at?

All of the below are linked:

* Objects/records
* Objects/effects/polymorphism
* Effects/coroutines
* Coroutines/sequences (generators)

At the risk of sounding wanky, it seems we need a holistic, consistent solution with the fewest possible number of concepts.

Open questions:

== Record type system

Still haven't implemented this as yet.

* Don't want to implement full algebraic subtyping - looks like it accepts types that we don't want to (e.g. bool âŠ” int).
* Thoughts about 'head sets', meaning that a type can't ever be unified to be in more than one class

== Objects/resources

These tie together with records (probably one of the reasons I haven't continued with the PoC yet)

We'd like (something like) objects to be used to manage both state and resources
We considered something like `(:!Taker Int)` to hold state, maybe this is suitable for resources too

We can then add methods to both `:!Taker` and `:Taker` - would these be effects?
  We then say that the type of such an object is 'something which has an <x> function'
  Can this be a record?

In this case, it might be possible for an object to have two head types - one being an object, the other being `:Taker`
I suppose we could unify these correctly - when we come to take the 'meet' of these types, we'd see that `:Taker` has those methods.

How does this combine with records/keys?

* There's two ways I'd like to add methods to objects - one as 'just records', the other added later as extensions
* Are object fields/keys in a record the same thing? why not?

Would love for records and objects to behave the same way, certainly.

Typeclass polymorphism is another consideration here - this enables things like return-type polymorphism.
Effects could be seen as type-class polymorphism where either the receiver is implicit, or there is no type parameter.
We should probably say 'where the receiver is implicit' to allow for multiple receivers.

What happens if we _do_ make the distinction between objects and records?
We wouldn't need a specific 'object' - records and variants would suffice
Methods would be the thing that would be separate
Implication would be that you couldn't just make an anonymous implementation for the functionality - but you could implement the functionality for a very easy record, separately.

We would then _only_ need typeclass polymorphism?

== Coroutines/Effects

NOTE: recent paper saying that any _unhandled_ effects are handled by the lexical environment - good combination of lexical and dynamic

== Sequences/Iterators/Generators

Generators feel like they won't be particularly performant unless they're inlined - will Truffle/Graal know enough to inline them?
We'll be passing them a yield function, I suppose, or we could compile them down to iterators (is that what Python/JS do?)
If we're compiling them down to iterators, I'd be tempted to not bother - we could potentially do that with macros
But then the `gen` macro isn't going to be hugely different to Clojure's lazy-seq, and it's much more imperative - is it worth introducing a new concept?
I feel like I want to base on iterators rather than lazy-seqs - get people into the habit of expecting to only iterate an iterator once
Thing is, something like lazy-seq is quite easy to use, maybe we could use something similar but just not have the implicit 'holding the head' thing.
(can always convert an iterable into a real sequence, of sorts)
can also concat two iterators lazily?
these are pull-based sequences, which I think I prefer
how would we close these? we considered `(try (doseq [...] (yield ...)) (finally (.close foo)))` but that's not going to work with lazy iterators

if the inner iterator is going to be a suspend fun, is this something we can cope with?
I suppose this is one for coroutines, above.
  maybe higher order functions need to have two compilations - one if their function is direct, another if it turns out to be a suspend fun
  if we do pass a suspend fun maybe the caller can ask for a suspend version of the callee?
  later.

would be stunned if Rich didn't consider iterators as the base, so why might he have chosen not to base Clojure on them?
when everything's a seq, in some form, it's much easier to deal with
we have Seqable, which a lot of core types implement.

likewise, Java added streams when they already had iterators - why? how are they implemented?

Spliterators were added in Java 8 as a revamp of Iterators.
Streams were then based on Spliterators - we should consider doing the same

Kotlin bases its sequence abstraction on iterators - so clearly not a silly idea
I'd like users to be able to create their own transformers, though
wrapSink seems like a good abstraction to write transformers over, I'd say

Spliterators have a `try-advance` function which takes a consumer.
If we were to call `map` on a Spliterator

Options:
* Bridje layer over Spliterators, translating Bridje calls into Spliterator calls
* Re-write it in Bridje
** Re-write it as built-ins
** Re-write it in Bridje itself (is Bridje powerful enough?)

Think it's fairly safe to say I'm going with Streams in _some_ way - implementation unclear, but don't think it'll impact the _language_.
